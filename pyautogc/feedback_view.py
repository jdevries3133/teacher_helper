"""
Automate the tedium of giving feedback on google-doc based assignments on google
classroom (WAY too much clicking â€“ no thank you).

Scroll down to class FeedbackAutomator for a sample implementation. To get
going easily, read through the docstrings there, subclass and overwrite
the comment_bank method for your own custom comments, and away you go with
my default configuration.

For deeper extensibility, subclass the abstract base. You can do a lot, but also
avoid writing a lot of annoying selenium code. You will have to define the
following abstract methods:
    - assess
    - comment_bank

Optionally, you may also overwrite the "grade" and "give_feedback" methods. See
documentation for those specific methods for details.

The lifecycle of these subclassable methods are:
    - self._get_context()   => self.context gains "name", "attachments", and "grade_divisor"
    - self.assess()         => self.context gains "grade"
    - self.grade()          => self.context gains "percentage_grade"; grade is entered into Google Classroom
    - self.give_feedback()  => self.context gains "feedback". Feedback is entered into the DOM
    - self._cleanup()       =>
