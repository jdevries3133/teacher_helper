THIS IS A SCRIPT.
It has no easily importable functionality and will not until I refactor it into
a class. I am pretty sure that in it's current location, it will not work at all.


The script helps with grading in google classroom. It can grade the same assignment
across multiple classrooms by iterating through homerooms of the appropriate
grade level. The script uses two constants, assignment name, and grade level.
It is also necessary to rewrite the comment bank for the given assignment.

Within the main() function, you can do many tricky things. For
example, you can incorporate acknowledgement for student completion of outside
work. Also, you can assign any attribute on the student object which can be
accessed later by the comment bank.
