# Overview

This is a library of stuff that I have, mostly unsuccessfully, used to automate
my work as a teacher. For the most part, it's been the primary means for me
learning object oriented programming, and has had a history of massive revision
as I continue to learn and fix my mistakes. There are currently three major
useful parts of this project:

1. <a href="#helper">teacherHelper</a>
2. <a href="#paychex">paychex</a>
3. <a href="#classroom-automator">pyautogc</a>

First, the Helper class encapsulates information that I deal with as a teacher.
The most important attribute is helper.students which is a dictionary; students'
full names are the keys, and Student class instances from `helper/student.py`
corresponding to that student are the values. Honestly, the Helper class is
really just your school's Student Information System, but in python. Look at
the classes helper.student.Student, helper.parent_guardian.ParentGuardian,
and helper.homeroom.Homeroom, and helper.group.Group. All of these classes
are nestled within the helper class so that you can compose loops and
make selections within python to find information on students. For example,

```
>>> helper.students.get('Johnny Smith').homeroom.teacher
Jones
>>> all_fourth = [s for s in helper.students.values() if s.grade_level == 4]
>>> all_fourth
[<helper.student.Student object at 0x1032862b0>, ...]
>>> {s.homeroom for s in all_fourth}
{"Jones", "Smith", "Henderson", ...}
```

## Top-Level `shell.py`

On my machine, I call this utility through
[this wrapper script,](https://github.com/jdevries3133/my_shell_scripts/blob/master/emp)
although there are many ways to set it up for yourself. Putting that script
in your `PATH` is nice, though, because you only need to change one constant,
and then things should "just work."

Importantly, you first need to create a virtual environment for the project.
First, figure out the command for python <= version 3.8 on your machine;

- `python3 --version` or `python3.8 --version`; whatever returns python3.8
  or higher

Then, create the virtual environment and install dependencies

- `[python3|python3.8] -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally, instantiate the helper object and create a cache by calling
`helper.write_cache()`.

### Usage

Once installed, shell.py provides the following utilities:

    Supported commands:

    student [name]
        Prints the student according to Student.__str__(). Provides basic
        student and guardian information.

    parent [parent/guardian name]
        Prints the student just like in student search, but search by
        parent instead of by student. Search algorithm prioritizes primary
        contacts; so a fuzzy string match with a primary contact at a
        lower confidence will be returned over a better match against a
        secondary contact.

    report [student name]
        Print a report for the student that includes zoom attendance
        record.

    clock
        Automatically clocks in or out of Paychex, depending on time of day
        and previous clock state.

    timer [minutes] [message]
        Start a timer that will say [message] after [minutes]. The message
        will be spoken by a robot voice.

    [no arguments]
        Run this script with no arguments, and it will enter the shell mode.
        Here, the helper object is instantiated in the local namespace with
        the variable name "helper". All attributes and methods are accessible.

<h2 id="helper-instantiation">Initial Instantiation</h2>

One of the most difficult things is first instation. The helper class gets
a new_school_year function from it's parent class, `OnCourseMixin`. This
method specifically works for me with the reports I can generate from OnCourse.

**`helper.new_school_year(cls, student_data, guardian_data, strict_headers=False)`**

Class method inherited from `helper/HelperMixins/oncourse/mixin.py`. The
student_data csv should have the following columns:

- first name
- last name
- grade level
- homeroom teacher
- email address

The guardian_data csv should have the following columns:

- first name
- last name
- student
- primary contact
- email
- mobile phone
- home phone
- work phone
- comments
- allow contact
- student resides with
- relationship to student

These reports can be easily exported from OnCourse, and by passing them into
this function, the helper class will be instantiated.

If `strict_headers` is set to true, it will look for an exact match in the
header column. By default, it just uses an "if in" match. It's pretty wonky;
probably just leave that alone.

## Helper Class Methods

### find_nearest_match(self, student_name, auto_yes=False)

Takes a student name and returns a Student instances. Asks for the user input
to confirm the nearest match if no exact match is found. Set auto_yes to false,
and it will not ask for user input, it will simply go with the best match.

<h1 id="paychex">Paychex</h1>

### Overview

Paychex class can clock in and out of paychex using headless Google Chrome,
selenium, and chromedriver.

### Methods

**`self.clock(self)`**

This is the primary top-level function â€“ the one that is called by passing
"clock" as a single argument to the shell. It takes into consideration the time
of day, cached clock state, and real site state, and makes a determination about
whether to press the button or not. It then updates the clock state and closes
the headless browser.

**`self.login(self)`**

Launch headless chrome and login to paychex. Unless you setup the Imap module
to get your OTP from your email, you will have to input it. This method does
not necessarily need to be called, because functions that require you to login
are protected by the `@login_first` decorator, which checks for `self.is_logged_in`
and calls this method if not.

**`self.clock_in(self)`**

Clock in. The @login_first decorator is applied, so if you haven't done that yet,
it will happen upon calling this method.

This method does not mindlessly press the button in paychex. It first reads the
DOM and checks if you're already clocked in. It may push the button, or may just
close the borwser if you're already clocked in. Either way,
**you will be clocked in when all is said and done**

**`self.clock_out(self)`**

Same as clock in, but clock out.

**`self.get_clock_state(self)`**

This returns the **LOCALLY CACHED** clock state. Can be used to check whether
the Browser should be opened, or to query the user for whether they want to
clock in or out when it's ambiguous.

**`self.set_clock_state(self)`**

This opens the browser, logs in, and gets the clock state from the website.
It does not take any arguments, or allow the state to by manually overridden.

**`@ login_first` decorator**

These methods will check whether `self.is_logged_in` is true.

<h1 id="classroom-automator">pyautogc</h1>

**The code is the documentation, good luck ðŸ˜‰**

This module follows a much cleaner Object Oriented design. The
`ClassroomAutomator` is the lowest base class with a lot of the selenium code
that actually navigates google classroom. The `FeedbackAutomatorBase` inherits
that functionality from the `ClassroomAutomator` class, and focuses on giving
feedback for google doc and slide based assignments in google classrooms,
which is quite tedious. However, this is an abstract class. It must be
subclassed whenever a user wants to give feedback on a specific assignment by
implementing the `assess`, and `comment_bank` methods. A sample implementation
can be found at the bottom of the file in the `FeedbackAutomator` class, which
is well documented.
