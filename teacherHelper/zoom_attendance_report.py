class MeetingSet(HelperConsumer):
    """

    # General Usage

    A directory full of meeting reports can be carelessly tossed into
    __init__. This class dynamically groups meetings by attendees. For example,
    if you use the same meeting topic (i.e. "Health") to meet with different
    groups of homerooms throughout the week, this class will observe the union
    of the set of attendees at each meeting instance, and if there is a
    significant intersection, those meetings are grouped.

    # Resultant Data Structure

    Meeting groupings will be accessible as a nested list (self.groups).
    Each item in the list will itself be a chronologically sorted list of
    Meeting instances. 

    The presumption is that there is no reliable way to know the full name of
    a meeting. For example, the meeting topic might be, "Health," but whoose
    homeroom is it? There's no way to know from here. Hence, this class simply
    takes a large pool of meetings and groups them. Labeling can be done
    elsewhere.

    The topics of each meeting are saved as an attribute on the
    meeting; "meeting.topic". It is possible for multiple meeting instances
    with the same topic to be split into different groups if the participants
    are different enough. This is expected such as in the example case detailed
    above. However, meetings with different topics will never be grouped
    together.

    If, for whatever reason, a teacher has meet with the same class under
    different zoom meet topics, that case could probably be dealt with in a
    more flexible subclass which modifies the "match_meeting_with_group_by_union"
    method.
